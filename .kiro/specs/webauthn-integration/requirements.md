# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements WebAuthn (Web Authentication) integration using the SimpleWebAuthn library to provide passwordless authentication capabilities. The implementation will extend the existing authentication system to support biometric authentication, security keys, and other WebAuthn-compatible authenticators. This will provide users with a more secure and convenient authentication method while maintaining compatibility with the existing username/password system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to register my biometric authenticator or security key, so that I can authenticate without entering a password.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates WebAuthn registration THEN the system SHALL generate registration options with appropriate challenge and user information
2. WHEN a user completes the authenticator registration process THEN the system SHALL verify and store the credential data securely
3. WHEN credential registration is successful THEN the system SHALL associate the credential with the user's account
4. IF a user already has registered credentials THEN the system SHALL allow multiple credentials per user
5. WHEN storing credential data THEN the system SHALL include credential ID, public key, counter, and device information

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to authenticate using my registered WebAuthn credential, so that I can access my account securely without a password.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates WebAuthn authentication THEN the system SHALL generate authentication options with appropriate challenge
2. WHEN a user provides their WebAuthn response THEN the system SHALL verify the authentication signature
3. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL issue a JWT token consistent with existing auth flow
4. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages
5. WHEN verifying authentication THEN the system SHALL update and validate the credential counter to prevent replay attacks

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my registered WebAuthn credentials, so that I can add, remove, or view my authentication devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests their credential list THEN the system SHALL return all registered credentials with device information
2. WHEN a user wants to remove a credential THEN the system SHALL delete the specified credential after proper authorization
3. WHEN displaying credentials THEN the system SHALL show friendly device names and registration dates
4. IF a user has no registered credentials THEN the system SHALL indicate this clearly
5. WHEN managing credentials THEN the system SHALL require existing authentication (JWT or WebAuthn)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-structured WebAuthn module, so that the code is maintainable and follows NestJS best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the WebAuthn feature THEN the system SHALL create a dedicated WebAuthn module with proper dependency injection
2. WHEN creating the data model THEN the system SHALL define a WebAuthn credential entity with appropriate database relationships
3. WHEN implementing services THEN the system SHALL separate concerns between credential management and authentication logic
4. WHEN creating API endpoints THEN the system SHALL follow RESTful conventions and include proper validation
5. WHEN integrating with existing auth THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with current JWT-based authentication

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want WebAuthn implementation to be secure and follow best practices, so that user credentials are protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating challenges THEN the system SHALL use cryptographically secure random values
2. WHEN storing credentials THEN the system SHALL never store private keys, only public key data
3. WHEN verifying authentication THEN the system SHALL validate origin, challenge, and signature according to WebAuthn specification
4. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL not leak sensitive information in error messages
5. WHEN configuring WebAuthn THEN the system SHALL use appropriate relying party settings for the application domain

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want to integrate WebAuthn on the client side, so that users can interact with their authenticators through the web interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks register WebAuthn THEN the frontend SHALL call the backend registration endpoint and handle the browser WebAuthn API
2. WHEN a user attempts WebAuthn login THEN the frontend SHALL call the backend authentication endpoint and process the response
3. WHEN WebAuthn operations complete THEN the frontend SHALL provide clear feedback about success or failure
4. IF WebAuthn is not supported THEN the frontend SHALL gracefully fallback or inform the user
5. WHEN integrating with existing UI THEN the frontend SHALL maintain consistency with current authentication flows
